# SCEM
Core code of the SCEM.

## Introduction

BTM-RB main method in /Algorithms/BTM-RB/model/btm_wvf_Adapter.py, the training can be carried out by modifying the parameters, and the training results are generated into a txt file.</br>

Topic coherence calculation in /Algorithms/BTM-RB/test/topic_word_test.py.</br>

The prototype system based on a browser/server structure is in /Web App. 
The system is implemented in Java, relies on Apache Tomcat 8.5 as a web application server, and uses a MySql 5.7 database. The front-end UI is implemented by HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and communicates with the server through AJAX technology.
