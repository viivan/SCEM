For example Sherlock Holmes Museum - to see what's up at Baker Street -> OK. Know the place and want to refresh memories? Or wanna check views of where never was before? Look, geo photos from flickr on the right... Click for the picture full details or browse for next. Previous tweets from specified location (as far as available) are reachable. These tweets location radius is adjustable as well (to investigate the exact place or wider range). One more cool feature is you can refine tweets within that radius for specific search words. For instance, to locate tweets with photos from these geotagged scope just enter word (at bottom left) photo -> click search within! Well, links on these photos (usually from fb, instagram, twitter, tumblr and others) are clickable... Hm... looking for ... what if to enter instagram cats -> search within? What are (they tweeting about) recent news in newspapers ... ok, let's check nytimes -> search within! More results? Just click Radius+ to increase search area... Still using google search? Better use (twitter geo powered) search within! BTW, how about vine.co twitter videos from the place? Sure, click THE VINES to watch it playlisted... Under tweets feel free to check what's top on Amazon by random category (at the moment from 10 available global locations)!
